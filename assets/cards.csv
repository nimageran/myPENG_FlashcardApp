Tort : A civil wrong where someone can be sued for harm they caused.

When the act is intentional (done on purpose), it is called an intentional tort—examples are fraud, trespass, and defamation. If the harm happens by accident or carelessness, it falls under negligence, not an intentional tort. In short, tort law deals with making the person who caused the harm legally responsible to compensate the victim."

card600,Right that lets a landowner cross neighbouring property for access,Easement (runs with the land).
card601,"Even if a case's facts match an older precedent, why might a court still refuse to follow that precedent?","Because subsequent judicial decisions, legislative changes, or material factual differences can override or distinguish the old rule—courts aren't bound when the law or key facts have evolved.

Example: A 1980 ruling on pesticide liability may be set aside today if newer statutes change industry standards or scientific evidence shows different health risks."
card602,Discrimination in pay for the same job,"No - employers may differentiate on legitimate grounds such as greater experience or tenure; human-rights statutes bar discrimination only on protected grounds (sex, race, age, etc.)."

card604,Easement,"A legal right allowing someone to use another person's land for a specific purpose.
An easement is like a permission slip that lets one person use part of another person's property without owning it. It gives a specific right—for example, to walk, drive, or run a utility line—over land they don't own. Easements stay with the land, so if the property is sold, the new owner still has that right. They help neighbors avoid conflicts by clearly laying out who can do what on which parts of the land.

Jane owns a house behind Tom's house and needs to walk across Tom's yard to reach the public sidewalk. Tom grants Jane an easement allowing her to use that path anytime. Jane doesn't own Tom's yard—she only has the right to walk along that path. If Jane sells her house, the new owner also keeps that walking right. Without the easement, Jane might have to build a costly private sidewalk or negotiate access each time."

1. Register your trademark federally, or

card621,CPD requirements after absence,Once you return to practice you must restart meeting the CPD requirements; missed years are not retro-billed.
card622,"Education Half-Life of a Degree-What does ""education half-life"" mean for professionals?","Over time, the relevance of what you learned in your degree decays (loses relevance) as technology and best practices evolve. The ""half-life"" is the period in which roughly half of your original knowledge becomes outdated, making ongoing learning essential to stay competent.

Example: If a computer science degree has an education half-life of 5 years, then about half of what you learned when you graduated will be obsolete after five years—so you need continual training to keep up.

Difficult word:Decay: to gradually lose strength or effectiveness."
card623,"Under provincial/territorial Occupational Health & Safety Acts, what action can a worker take when faced with a dangerous task?","Workers have the legal right to stop work and refuse tasks they reasonably believe are unsafe.Example: On a construction site, if a worker notices a scaffold platform missing planks, they can refuse to climb it and report the hazard to their supervisor without fear of reprisal."

3. Consideration - Each gives something of value (money, service).
4. Capacity - Parties are competent (e.g., adults of sound mind).
5. Lawful Purpose - The contract's goal must be legal.

Example: You offer $200 for a friend to paint your room, they accept, both intend a binding deal, you'll pay $200 (consideration), you're both adults (capacity), and painting is legal (lawful purpose)."
card625,What is estoppel in contract law?,"When one party knowingly gives up (""waives"") a strict right under a contract and the other party relies on that waiver, a court will prevent the first party from later enforcing the original term.

Example:A landlord tells a tenant it's okay to pay rent up to three days late each month. The tenant relies on this and pays late for several months. The landlord cannot suddenly enforce the strict ""due on the first"" clause for those months—they're estopped (stopped) from doing so."
card626,"In a practice review, what's the main focus for an individual member vs. a firm?","Individual: Are they staying competent and honestly logging their CPD?

Firm: Is it following its PPMP (Professional Practice Management Plan)?
