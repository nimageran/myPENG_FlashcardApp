(Technical know-how means Skills, methods, and practical knowledge you gain through work or training. And, 
NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) means A legal contract saying you must keep certain information secret.)","Yes—skills and knowledge become part of your experience, though facts under NDA stay confidential. Or in other words, Yes. You can use your general skills and experience, but you must not disclose or use the client’s confidential information (e.g., proprietary data, drawings, code, trade secrets)."

card16,Golden Rule and ethical theories,"The Golden Rule , which says ""treat others how you want to be treated"" fits into all four major ethical theories.

Kant would say it’s your duty.

Mill would like it because it leads to good outcomes for many.

Locke would support it because it respects others’ rights.

Aristotle would call it a sign of good character.
So, it’s a rule that almost every moral system agrees with."

card27,Non-disclosure (confidentiality) clause,Best protects an employer's trade secrets if an employee later leaves.
card28,"Canadian product-liability ""duty-of-care"" precedent case","Donoghue v. Stevenson - manufacturer owes reasonable care to end-user.

In Donoghue v. Stevenson, the court said that manufacturers must take reasonable care to make sure their products are safe for the people who use them.
This case created the rule that you can be held responsible if someone is hurt because you didn’t make your product safely—even if they didn’t buy it directly from you.

Example

A woman found a snail in her ginger beer and got sick.
She didn’t buy the drink herself, but the manufacturer was still held responsible.
Why? Because they had a duty of care to anyone who might drink their product.
This case showed that companies can’t ignore the end-user’s safety.
It helped shape the modern idea of negligence law."
card29,First screening question in engineering ethical dilemma,"""Does this situation endanger public health or safety?"" - if yes, act immediately (up to whistle-blowing)."
card30,Are electronic records less reliable than paper records for evidence?,"No. Form/media doesn’t matter. Records are reliable if you can prove integrity, completeness, and authenticity. Electronic and hard-copy are equally acceptable. "
card31,Peer review of another engineer's work,No permission required; courtesy notification is enough; employer/client can mandate the review.

card36,"Protecting oneself when proposing an unusual, higher-risk design approach",Fully disclose the risks to the client and obtain informed acceptance; risk then shifts to the informed client.
card37,What is material non-disclosure in professional liability insurance?,"Failing to reveal relevant information (e.g., a prior negligence claim) when purchasing Errors & Omissions (E&O) coverage. Such nondisclosure is ""material"" because it influences the insurer's decision—omitting it can void the policy."

card46,"Single best defence against a negligence lawsuit.
(A negligence lawsuit is when someone takes another person to court because they got hurt or suffered damage due to the other person not being careful enough. Imagine a grocery store didn’t clean up a spill for hours.
You walk in, slip on it, and break your arm.
The store was supposed to keep the floors safe and clean.
Since they didn’t, that’s called negligence.
You could file a lawsuit asking for money to cover your medical bills.
That’s a negligence lawsuit.)","Produce careful, thorough, accurate work (quality first). Insurance only mitigates losses after the fact.
(Because quality work prevents negligence from occurring. Insurance can’t stop a lawsuit—it only helps cover losses afterward.)"
card47,"Posting false, damaging statements online about a competitor",Constitutes libel → an actionable tort claim; internet posts are fully enforceable.

card54,Tendering law (Ron Engineering): what is Contract A?,A bidding contract formed with every compliant bidder once their tender is submitted.
card55,Legal doctrine that says land-sale agreements must be in writing,"Statute of Frauds.

The Statute of Frauds is a rule that says agreements to sell land must be written down to be legally valid. You can’t just rely on verbal promises when it comes to selling or buying land. If it’s not in writing, the deal usually won’t hold up in court. This protects people from fraud or confusion. It’s a way to make land deals clear and official.

Example:

Mark tells Lisa he’ll sell her a piece of land for $50,000, and she agrees—but they don’t write anything down. Later, Mark changes his mind. Because there’s no written contract, Lisa probably can’t force the sale. If they had written and signed an agreement, the Statute of Frauds would make it enforceable."
card56,Engineers Canada Code of Ethics,What must you provide for subordinates? Opportunities for their professional development.
card57,Insurance nickname that protects professionals,Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance.
card58,2004 amendment that made workplace-safety violations potentially a criminal offence,The Criminal Code was amended to impose criminal liability on those who direct work but fail to protect workers/public.

card61,Turning a filed lien claim into an enforceable charge,Process is called 'perfecting the lien.'
card62,Negligent-misrepresentation suits - strongest defence when claimant would have acted the same anyway,"Lack of causation (no reliance): if the plaintiff was already committed to the course of action, the misstatement did not cause the loss."
card63,Rule from Rylands v Fletcher - strict liability,Injured party need not prove negligence once the non-natural use of land causes escape and damage.
card64,What question does the reasonable person test ask? And for which cases this test is being used?,"Asks 'What would a reasonable person have done in the same circumstances?'

The reasonable person test is used in negligence cases to see if someone acted carefully enough.
It asks, “What would an average, careful person have done in the same situation?”
If the person didn’t act like that, they may be found negligent.

Example

A store owner doesn’t clean up a spilled drink, and a customer slips.
A court asks: Would a reasonable person have cleaned the spill quickly to prevent danger?
If yes, and the owner didn’t, that’s likely negligence.
The test helps decide if someone’s behavior was careless or acceptable."
card65,"Joint liability, one defendant bankrupt - who pays?","The solvent defendant may be forced to pay 100 % of the damages, then seek (often futile) contribution from the defunct party."
card66,"Large, controversial projects (e.g., inter-provincial pipeline): likely federal EA review types",Mediation or Panel Review under the Impact Assessment Act/CEAA.
card67,Corporate environmental audit - which benefit is NOT provided?,It does not grant a tax break simply for undertaking the audit.
card68,"Phase III Environmental Site Assessment (ESA): What does it deliver, and what does it NOT repeat?","Delivers: a remediation plan, detailed description of contaminants, and how we’ll check if it worked (with confirmatory sampling). 
Does NOT repeat Phase I historical-title/previous-owner/neighbour information. 
ESA = Environmental Site Assessment. "
card69,Strict-liability environmental offences - weakest due-diligence proof,Merely having a paper policy (with no evidence of implementation/monitoring) rarely satisfies due diligence.
card70,Contract with a mandatory arbitration clause - can a party refuse and litigate instead?,"No. Once signed, parties are bound; the court can even appoint an arbitrator if they cannot agree.

If you sign a contract with a mandatory arbitration clause, you can’t choose to go to court instead. You’ve already agreed to solve disputes through arbitration only. Even if both parties can’t pick an arbitrator, a court will assign one for them. So, once it’s signed, you’re stuck with arbitration. The court won’t let you skip it and sue instead.

Example:

Emma signs a contract to work on a project. It says all disputes must go to arbitration. Later, there's a disagreement, and Emma tries to sue the company in court. The court refuses because of the mandatory arbitration clause. Even if Emma and the company can’t agree on who should arbitrate, the court will pick someone. She must go through arbitration."
card71,"In Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), what is “negotiation” and is the outcome enforceable?","Negotiation = direct discussion/compromise between the parties (no third party). If they reach agreement and sign it, it becomes an enforceable contract."
card72,PIPEDA data-collection principle that is NOT in the Act,"No rule limiting use to one year; PIPEDA requires purpose identification, consent, access, safeguards, etc., but sets no fixed time-limit."
card73,"Harris, Pritchard & Rabins ""Golden Rule"" for engineers abroad - which action is not one of the nine ethical guidelines?","""Paternalize local citizens."" Professionals should not impose their own choices on local people."
card74,Cutting an employee's salary 20 % without consent is treated as what kind of termination?,"Constructive dismissal - employee may treat contract as terminated and sue for severance/notice.

If a boss cuts someone’s salary by 20% without asking, that’s called constructive dismissal. Even though the person wasn’t directly fired, the change is so serious that the law sees it as a forced resignation. The employee can then quit and sue the employer as if they were fired. They may get severance pay or notice. It's like being pushed out without being told outright.
Example:

John’s boss suddenly cuts his salary from $60,000 to $48,000 without asking. John quits because he can’t accept that pay cut. Even though he resigned, the law sees it as if he was forced out. That’s constructive dismissal. Now, John can take legal action to get severance pay or notice compensation."
card75,Quebec Civil Code - UNtrue statement about contract interpretation,"Strict, literal wording overrides common intention → UNTRUE. Code says common intention prevails over literal text."
card76,One of the four elements of fraudulent misrepresentation,Defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the false statement.
card77,Waiver & estoppel,Owner's conduct waived the written-approval clause; contract is not voided.
card78,"Conditions for voiding a contract for mutual mistake

(To Void a contract means to cancel or make a contract no longer legally binding. And, Mutual mistake means When both sides of a contract are wrong about the same important fact.)","1) Significant impact on performance/cost 2) Both parties shared the mistaken assumption 3) Mistake existed when contract formed.

Imagine two people make a deal to sell a rare painting they both think is real. Later, they find out it’s a fake. The price they agreed on doesn’t make sense anymore. Since they both believed it was real when they made the contract, and that belief seriously affected the value, the contract can be voided. It’s like saying, “We were both wrong, so let’s undo the deal.”"
card79,Application of Canadian common law in Québec,"In matters of federal jurisdiction (e.g., criminal law, patents, Admiralty)."
card80,"Clauses in multi-jurisdiction contracts.

(Multi-jurisdiction means Involving more than one country or state in legal matters.)",1) Governing-law clause (which jurisdiction's law applies) 2) Forum/venue clause (which courts will hear any dispute).
card81,Element of fraudulent misrepresentation,Defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the false statement.
card82,Verbal owner approvals and contract survival,Waiver & estoppel - owner's conduct waived the written-approval clause; contract is not voided.
card83,What is a passing-off action?,"You must have a trademark (registered or common-law) that the public associates with your goods/services; mere similarity of un-trademarked trade names is not enough.

A passing-off action is when you sue someone for pretending to be your brand.
To win, you must prove you have a trademark (official or based on long-time use) that the public recognizes.
Just having a name that’s similar isn’t enough if you haven’t built a clear connection to it.

Example

You’ve run ""Bella Bean Coffee"" for 10 years, and locals know your name and logo.
Someone opens “Bella’s Beans” nearby with similar colors and fonts.
If you have a trademark, or the public already links your name to your business, you can sue for passing off.
But if your name isn’t well-known or protected, you likely won’t win just because it “sounds similar.”"
card84,Is the Criminal Code part of the Canadian Constitution?,"No — it is a separate federal statute.


Think of the Constitution as the “rules of the entire game.”

The Canadian Constitution is the highest law in the whole country.
It tells us:

• how the government works
• what powers each level of government has
• your fundamental rights (like freedom of expression, equality rights)

This stuff is permanent, foundational, and hard to change.

The Criminal Code is just one law — a very big law — created by Parliament under the powers the Constitution grants.

It lists crimes and punishments.
Assault, fraud, theft, harassment, homicide — they all live there.

But the Criminal Code depends on the Constitution to exist.

Because the Constitution is supreme.
If part of the Criminal Code violates the Constitution, the courts can strike it down.

Example:
Let’s say you and I are playing soccer.

The Constitution = the official FIFA rules
(they define what soccer is, who can do what, and what limits exist)

The Criminal Code = your coach giving you team rules
(“Nima, don’t slide tackle from behind,”
“Nima, no fighting the referee,”
“Nima, if you kick someone in the face, you get benched.”)

The coach’s rules matter…
…but if the coach makes a rule that breaks FIFA rules, it gets thrown out.

Same thing:
Criminal Code must obey the Constitution.
Because the Constitution is the foundation — the sport itself.



"
card85,"What is the only defence to a strict-liability environmental offence?

(A strict-liability offence means you can be legally punished just for doing something wrong, even if you didn’t mean to. It doesn’t matter if it was an accident — if the law was broken, you're responsible. However, you can defend yourself by proving due diligence (you tried your best to follow the rules).",Due diligence - you must prove you took all reasonable steps to obey the law and prevent harm.(due diligence = reasonable effort)
card86,What is Contra proferentem rule? ,"An ambiguous clause is read against the drafter and in favour of the other party.

If a contract has a confusing part, it will be interpreted against the person who wrote it.
This rule helps protect the other person, who didn’t create the unclear wording.
It encourages drafters to write clear and fair contracts.
So, if you’re the one writing, be careful—vague terms can backfire.
This rule is called ""contra proferentem"" and it favors the non-drafting side.

3) Example

Imagine a company writes a contract that says, “Service will be available in the evening,” but doesn’t define what “evening” means.
If a customer later complains that service wasn’t available at 6 PM, the court may side with the customer.
Why? Because the company wrote the contract and left it unclear.
So, the unclear term is used against the company.
This rule motivates people to be clear and precise when drafting contracts.
It’s about fairness and clarity."
card87,"Who can file a construction/builders' lien in Canada?
(Lien - a legal claim on property used as security for payment of a debt.)","Any party who improved the property - contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or professional - may register a lien for unpaid work or materials."
card88,Duress in contract signing,Contracts signed under duress can be set aside.
card89,Basic test items a plaintiff must prove in a negligence suit,"Need duty of care, breach, and causation of damage - a contract between parties is NOT required."
card90,Key elements that keep international contracts out of 'conflict-of-laws' trouble,Include a governing-law clause and a forum clause naming which court will hear any dispute.
card91,Tort claim without a contract,A claim in negligence - duty of care exists even without a contract.
card92,Unregistered trademark rights,Under common-law you gain unregistered (common-law) trademark rights through continued public use.
card93,Project delivery method without a general contractor,Called Construction Management (owner + construction manager + separate trade contracts).
card94,What is the purpose of a comparative-negligence clause in a contract?,"To fairly divide financial responsibility according to each party’s level of fault.

Example: 

Imagine a delivery company crashes into a store’s wall, but the store didn’t follow safety rules either. A comparative-negligence clause says the delivery driver is 70% at fault, and the store is 30% at fault. So, if damages cost $10,000, the driver (or their company) pays $7,000 and the store pays $3,000. Without this clause, one side might have to pay for everything, even if both were careless. This way, blame is shared fairly."
card95,"If a supplier isn’t paid by a broke contractor, what legal remedy can they use to try to get paid?

(Filing a lien means Legally claiming a right to someone’s property because you weren’t paid.)",Supplier unpaid for materials can't collect from broke contractor can still file a lien against the owner's property for the value supplied.
card96,"What's the primary purpose of intellectual property (IP) law?

(IP law = rules governing patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc.)","To encourage creativity by protecting creators' rights and providing a fair, organized way to share and license ideas.

• E.g., copyright lets authors control and license books, so they're paid when others use their work."
card97,How are workers' compensation insurance premiums calculated?,"Premiums are charged per employee and then adjusted by a risk rate reflecting the employer's industry hazard level.

• Higher-risk industries (e.g., construction) have higher rate multipliers.


Example: A construction firm (high-risk) with 10 employees and a rate of $2 per employee pays 10 × $2 = $20.

Notes:
Premium: the insurance cost you pay.
Risk rate: a multiplier based on how hazardous the work is."
card98,Investigation of new matters,Most Acts let the panel investigate any new matters that arise during the investigation.
card99,"Under APEGA's six CPD categories, mentoring a Member-in-Training (MIT) falls under which category, and what does that involve?","Participation
• Involves interactive activities—guiding, coaching or collaborating with others.
• Example: Pairing with an MIT on a real project, reviewing their work and offering feedback.

CPD (Continuing Professional Development): ongoing learning to maintain competenceMIT (Member-in-Training): someone gaining required work experience under supervision"
card100,Investigative Committee-What is the role of the Investigative Committee?,"The Investigative Committee gathers facts, reviews evidence and witness statements, and recommends charges if there's sufficient cause.

Example: After a safety complaint, the committee interviews employees, examines site records, and suggests whether the engineer should face a formal discipline hearing.

Difficult word:Recommend: to formally suggest a course of action."
card101,"Which sanction is NOT normally used by professional Discipline Committees?
Revocation
Suspension
Fine
Community service

(Sanction: an official penalty or disciplinary measure.)","Community service: Professional regulators impose fines, suspensions, license revocations or terms/conditions—but do not order community service (that's a criminal court penalty).

Example: An engineer found guilty might be fined or temporarily forbidden to practice, but won't be told to ""volunteer at a food bank"" as part of their discipline."
card102,Investigation committee dropping a complaint,If the claim is frivolous (trivial / no merit) or vexatious (meant to harass or annoy).
card103,"Key PRB check for licence reinstatement

(PRB = Practice Review Board - the committee that audits returning or practising members' competence;

Reinstatement = restoring a lapsed or inactive licence so you can practise again)","They verify whether the profession's standard of practice changed during the time you were not practising.Example: If you stopped working in 2015 and new building codes came into effect in 2018, the PRB will check that you're up to date before restoring your licence."
card104,Arbitration mean A legal process where a neutral third person (arbitrator) decides a dispute instead of going to court. Arbitration chosen after a dispute begins is called ________.,"Voluntary binding arbitration.

(Voluntary binding arbitration means both sides agree after a problem starts to let an arbitrator decide, and they promise to follow that decision.)"
card105,Trust provision,funds received must be held in trust for subcontractors/suppliers.
card106,"What is a descriptive mark, and is it protectable?","A descriptive mark directly describes the goods/services and is not registrable/protectable as a trademark (e.g., “gelato” for ice cream). "
card107,Industrial design,protected look/ornamentation of a manufactured item.
card108,Learned intermediary,a professional positioned between maker and consumer who must give warnings.
card109,Innocent misrepresentation,"false statement honestly believed by the seller; remedy is rescission (contract cancelled), no damages."
card110,"A contractor didn't do what they supposed to do. Who steps in under the bond, and up to what dollar limit?

(A surety is like a co-signer who is on the hook from day one — if the main person fails, the surety must pay right away. A guarantor, on the other hand, is more like a backup — they only have to pay if the original person didn’t do their job first. So, the surety is equally responsible, while the guarantor is second in line.)","The surety (third-party guarantor) steps in, up to the bond’s face value (the capped amount the surety is liable for). "
card111,Biggest disadvantage of a sole proprietorship,"Unlimited personal liability for debts and lawsuits.

In a sole proprietorship, the owner is the same as the business. If the business owes money or gets sued, the owner has to pay with their own money. This means they could lose personal things like their car, house, or savings. This is called unlimited personal liability, and it's the biggest risk of running a business alone. There's no legal protection for the owner's personal property.

Example:

Maria owns a bakery by herself. One day, a customer sues her because they got sick from her food. The court says Maria has to pay $100,000. But her bakery only has $20,000. Because of unlimited personal liability, Maria must pay the rest—$80,000—from her personal savings or even by selling her car or house."

(Wrongful = improper or against the law)

Example: A delivery driver negligently causes a collision while making company deliveries. The employer can be sued for damages under vicarious liability."
card115,Copyright ownership when contract is silent,The engineer (author) keeps copyright; employer owns only normal 'work product' unless agreed otherwise.
card116,Letter of intent (LOI),'It slows the construction process' - actually used to start work quickly while full contract is finalized.
card117,Trust provision in lien law,Forces a contractor to use owner's money first to pay subcontractors/suppliers before anything else.

card119,Payment-bond Mr Baker should require from subs,Labour & material payment bond - ensures lower-tier parties get paid.
card120,Type of bond guaranteeing a contractor's completion performance,"Surety cannot make owner pay the difference; if new bid is higher, surety pays (up to bond value)."
card121,Item that is NOT a branch of law,"Subrogation - it's a reimbursement mechanism, not a legal field."
card122,Situation least likely to trigger a complaint to an engineering regulator,Charging slightly higher fees than competitors - pricing alone rarely breaches the Act.

card132,"When can disability be a lawful ground for discrimination?

(Ground (in law) means A reason or basis for taking legal action or making a legal decision.)","Disability - if the job's bona-fide requirements can't be met even with accommodation.

Example: A fire department needs firefighters to carry heavy equipment. Someone with a disability applies but can’t meet that physical requirement, even with special tools or modified duties.
Since lifting is a core part of the job, the department can lawfully reject the applicant.
This is discrimination, but it's allowed because the job has a bona-fide need.

(A bona-fide need is something that’s truly required, not just a preference. In jobs, it means a task or skill that is so important that the job can’t be done without it. It must be fair, necessary, and not made up to exclude people.)

(Accommodation means Adjustments or changes made to help someone with a disability do their job.)"

card142,Examples of Tort,"Example: Imagine Alex, an engineer, lies about a bridge's safety to win a contract—this fraud is an intentional tort. If Alex also walks onto a restricted construction site without permission, that's trespass. Later, Alex tells clients that another engineer is incompetent even though it isn't true; that's defamation. Each of these deliberate actions can lead the injured parties to sue Alex for damages under tort law. If Alex had simply mis-calculated a load because of sloppy math, that would be negligence, not an intentional tort."

card152,Which code takes precedence if a technical-society code conflicts with a provincial code?,"The provincial/territorial association’s Code of Ethics prevails.

If a national or technical group’s rules disagree with your local (provincial or territorial) ethics rules, you must follow the local code. That’s because the provincial code has legal authority in that region. Even if the technical society is well-known, its rules are secondary. Local rules override the others when they conflict. Always follow the provincial association’s Code of Ethics first.

Example:

Imagine you're an engineer in Alberta and follow both Engineers Canada’s and IEEE’s rules. If IEEE says it’s okay to accept gifts from clients but Alberta’s code says no gifts allowed, you must follow Alberta’s rule. Even though IEEE is a respected technical society, Alberta’s code is the law in your province. So the local rule wins in a conflict."
card153,Site coordinator responsibility on large Alberta construction site,Must protect all workers on site and anyone in the vicinity affected by site hazards.
card154,Difference between 'environmental compliance' and 'sustainability',"Compliance = day-to-day legal minimum; sustainability = long-term strategy.

Environmental compliance is doing the required legal minimum each day to avoid violations.
Sustainability is a bigger, long-term plan to improve environmental and social outcomes.
Compliance = reactive (follow rules); sustainability = proactive (set goals, innovate).
Compliance answers “Are we legal?”; sustainability asks “Are we responsible and future-proof?”
You need compliance now, but sustainability guides the future.

3) Example

A factory installs filters to meet air emission limits — that’s compliance.
It then sets a goal to cut GHG emissions 50% by 2030, invests in renewables, and redesigns packaging — that’s sustainability.
Compliance prevents fines; sustainability earns trust and saves resources.
Compliance is checklists and permits; sustainability is targets and innovation.
Both matter, but they play different roles."

card196,Sale of Goods Act,"The Sale of Goods Act implies three conditions that every product must satisfy: 1) Usability / fitness-for-purpose 2) Safety 3) Quality.

The Sale of Goods Act is a law that says all sold products must meet three basic standards: they must work properly (fit for their purpose), be safe to use, and be of good quality. Even if these rules aren’t written in a contract, they still apply automatically. If a product fails one of these, the buyer can ask for a refund or replacement. These protections are built into the sale by default.

Example:

Sara buys a kettle that doesn’t boil water, overheats, and breaks in two days. Under the Sale of Goods Act, she can return it. The kettle isn’t fit for purpose, isn’t safe, and lacks quality. Even if the store didn’t mention these rules, the law still protects Sara. She's entitled to a refund or new product."
card197,Mill's Utilitarianism,Selecting the option that brings the greatest good to the greatest number embodies Mill's Utilitarianism.
card198,Finality vs. interpretation,"In codes & standards practice, 'finality' is the state a document reaches after the professional has applied all relevant codes & standards and it is ready for others to act on; 'interpretation' is the professional judgement used to select, understand, and apply those codes & standards correctly."

card209,What is the main purpose of a Communications-System Policy (CSP)?,"Main purpose is to educate staff on risks/liabilities of digital communications (e.g., email, chat apps) & set acceptable-use rules for email, IM, etc.

A Communications-System Policy (CSP) tells staff how to safely and properly use work tools like email and messaging.
It teaches them about risks (like data leaks or lawsuits) and sets clear rules for what’s allowed.
The goal is to protect both the company and the employees.

Example

An employee sends a personal joke to a coworker over work email.
The CSP says email should only be used for business purposes.
It also warns that messages can be monitored and might be used in legal cases.
Because of the policy, the employee now knows to keep personal chats off work systems.

card234,What should you do if a project goes beyond your competence?,"Seek qualified assistance immediately; do not delay the client's project while you retrain (NPPE III.3).

If a job goes beyond your skills, you must get qualified help right away.
Don’t try to handle it alone or delay the client’s work while you retrain.
The priority is protecting the client and doing the work properly and safely.

Example

An engineer is asked to design a complex electrical system but only has experience with mechanical design.
Instead of trying to figure it out slowly or saying yes and hoping for the best, they call in an electrical expert.
This keeps the project moving and avoids mistakes.
The engineer can learn more later, but the client’s project must not suffer in the meantime."

card276,"Collegial (Theory Y) management style: How do staff operate, and what is the manager's role?

(""Collegial"" just means ""cooperative and friendly, like colleagues working together as equals,"" not anything to do with college classes. It comes from the same root as ""colleague,"" meaning peers, rather than from ""college.""
Ask ChatGPT)","Staff work autonomously within an agreed framework; the manager acts as a facilitator—providing guidance, resources and removing obstacles—rather than micromanaging each task.

Example: A design team defines its own milestones and divides tasks among themselves; the manager checks in to offer support or training but doesn't assign or oversee every detail."
card277,Accepting a job with a client's competitor,New contract must not require disclosure of former client's confidential affairs.
card278,Recommending your brother-in-law for paid work,What must you do first? Fully disclose the relationship to the client to manage the conflict of interest.

card283,What does a Commercial General Liability (CGL) policy cover for engineering businesses?,"Third-party bodily injury (BI) and property damage (PD).

Commercial General Liability (CGL)
A type of insurance that protects businesses if someone else gets hurt or their property is damaged because of the business’s operations.

A CGL policy helps engineering businesses if someone outside the company gets hurt or has their property damaged because of the company’s work. It doesn’t cover damage to the company’s own things—just problems caused to others. This is important because it protects the business from lawsuits and big bills if accidents happen during a project or at the office.

Imagine an engineering company is visiting a client’s building, and one of their tools falls and injures someone—that’s bodily injury. Or maybe they accidentally damage a server room, causing expensive problems—property damage. In both cases, the CGL insurance would help pay for legal costs or compensation. That way, the business doesn't have to pay out of pocket."
card284,Indigenous-reserve projects: why can't you finance by mortgage?,Mortgages can't be registered on reserve land because the land is generally unpatented (Crown/Indigenous ownership).

card286,When can an engineer/geoscientist file a construction lien?,"Allowed if the engineer/geoscientist is a prime consultant (not merely a sub-consultant).

An engineer or geoscientist can file a lien to claim unpaid money only if they were hired as the main consultant (called a prime consultant). If they worked under someone else (like a sub-consultant), they can’t file a lien. The right to file a lien is for those who are directly responsible to the client. This helps protect primary contractors, not every person involved.

Example:

Jane is an engineer hired directly by a building owner to manage the whole project. If she doesn’t get paid, she can file a lien on the property to get her money. But Sam, who worked under Jane doing only part of the work, cannot file a lien himself. Only Jane has that legal right, since she is the prime consultant."
card287,Must money always change hands to form a contract?,"No. Consideration can be anything of value, not necessarily cash."
card288,"Sexual-harassment cases are heard where, and how broadly is harassment defined?","Human-rights tribunal; takes a wide view - unwelcome comments or advances suffice, no physical assault needed."
card289,"What offence involves buying shares based on confidential test results, and under which law is it prohibited?","Insider trading - illegal under the Criminal Code of Canada, section 382.1."
card290,What does federal law require when a project may affect Indigenous rights on claimed land?,"Duty rests on the Crown (government) for any project on claimed land, proven or unproven.

Example

Let’s say the government wants to build a pipeline through a forest. An Indigenous group says that land is part of their traditional territory, even if no court has officially confirmed it yet. The government still has a duty to talk with them, listen to their concerns, and possibly change the plan to reduce harm. That’s consultation and accommodation, and it's the government’s job, not the company’s."
card291,Accurate description of force majeure clause,"Excuses delay for events beyond parties' control (e.g., strikes, fires, pandemics)."
card292,What must a consultant and client do under Qualifications-Based Selection (QBS) for scope?,Jointly develop the detailed scope of services after selection.
card293,Subsurface anchors installed without consent on a neighbour's land,"Is it trespass? Yes. Property rights extend below and above the surface; unauthorized encroachment is trespass even if harmless.

Yes, it is trespass if you install things like anchors underground on someone else’s land without their permission. Property rights don’t just cover the surface—they go above and below the ground too. Even if the anchor doesn’t cause any damage, it’s still illegal. The law says unauthorized use is trespassing, no matter how harmless it seems. You always need the owner’s consent.

Example:

A contractor installs anchors underground that extend into a neighbour’s property. The anchors are hidden and don’t cause any harm. But the neighbour didn’t agree to it. Even though nothing is damaged, the contractor has trespassed. The neighbour could legally demand removal or sue for it."
card294,"In Canadian tort law, what is a professional’s “duty to warn”?",An obligation to warn about impending damage or injury to people or property when aware (or reasonably foreseeable). It applies even if the hazard isn’t in your scope—you must take steps to warn/prevent harm.

Specs: short for ""specifications,"" the detailed description of work and materials","Because it typically involves many stakeholders (owners, general contractors, subcontractors, suppliers) plus massive volumes of technical records—drawings, specs (detailed requirements), emails—that lawyers must painstakingly review.

Example:A delay dispute on a high-rise can drag on 12 months when counsel from the owner, GC and three subs pore over 10,000 emails and 800 CAD drawings—each page adding hours of billable time."
card304,Which court handles cases related to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?,"The Supreme Court of Canada.

Here is the relation between the Charter and the Constitution:
The Charter is the part of the Constitution that protects your basic rights.

▪️ Meaning of ""jointly and severally"": Each partner can be held responsible both together (jointly) and on their own (severally) for the entire obligation.
▪️ Example: The partnership owes a supplier $50 000. The supplier can sue Partner A alone for the full $50 000, or any other partner, regardless of who actually ordered the goods."

card312,What is mediator confidentiality in dispute resolution?,"Definition: All communications (written or spoken) shared with the mediator during a mediation are legally privileged, meaning they cannot be disclosed or used later in arbitration or court.
Key term: Privileged - protected by law from being revealed as evidence.
Example: In private caucus, Company A admits it overlooked a safety risk. That admission stays in mediation and can't be brought into a later lawsuit."
card313,10% bid bond,"Guarantees that the winning bidder will enter into the contract and supply performance security; if the bidder backs out, the surety pays the owner up to the bond amount (typically 10% of the bid)."
card314,TN entry for Canadian engineer,Proof of Canadian or Mexican citizenship + a letter or contract describing the professional purpose of entry.
card315,What is Governing-law clause?,"Definition: A governing-law clause is a part of a contract that tells which state or country's laws will be used to decide any arguments about the deal. It helps everyone know in advance where to go and what rules to follow if they disagree. By choosing a specific jurisdiction, the parties reduce surprises and legal costs. This clause appears near the end of most agreements. It's especially important in deals crossing borders.
Key term: Jurisdiction → the legal authority or region whose courts and laws apply.
Example: ""Imagine two companies—one in California and one in Germany—signing a sales contract. They include a governing-law clause saying California law will apply. Later, they disagree over payment terms. Both sides then know they must ask a California court to interpret the contract. This saves time debating which country's rules to use. It makes the legal process clearer and faster.""

card317,What is a no-damages-for-delay clause in a construction contract?,"Blocks a contractor from claiming extra ""damages"" (compensation) for delays they cause, but doesn't stop claims if the owner orders a shutdown.

• Example: If a crew miss-schedule causes a week's delay, the contractor gets no extra pay. But if the owner suspends work for permits, the contractor can recover added costs."
card318,What is a per-diem rate and when is it best used?,"Definition: A fixed daily fee paid to a consultant (""per diem"" = ""per day"").
Use it when: The project's scope or hours can't be accurately predicted—gives cost certainty and flexibility.
Example: Hiring a site manager at $800/day, whether they oversee 1 task or 10 tasks in a day."
card319,What is quantum meruit and when can you use it?,"Definition: Latin for ""as much as deserved."" Allows you to recover a reasonable value for services and materials when no formal contract exists but the work was accepted.
Example: You clear a flooded basement in an emergency without a contract; the homeowner benefits and refuses to pay—so you sue on quantum meruit to get paid fairly."

card323,"Loser-Pays Cost Rule-What is it, and why does it matter?","▪️ Definition: A rule in many legal systems where the party that loses a lawsuit must pay a portion (or all) of the winning party's legal costs.
▪️ Purpose: Deters frivolous or weak claims by adding a financial consequence for the loser.
▪️ Example:Acme Corp sues Beta Ltd over a minor contract ambiguity. The court finds in Beta's favor and orders Acme to pay Beta's legal fees. Acme thinks twice before filing similar baseless suits in the future."
card324,Workers'-comp premiums,Calculated per employee and adjusted for the risk level of the employer's industry.
card325,Arbitration in construction contracts,"Construction contracts often use arbitration instead of court because it is generally faster, cheaper, and private compared with litigation."
card326,Entering the U.S. as a Canadian engineer under CUSMA/USMCA,Proof of Canadian citizenship + a letter or contract stating the professional purpose (TN category).
card327,What is a change order?,"A change order is basically a small written update to the contract when something changes during the project.
Think of it as a receipt that says:

how much extra work is being added

or how much work is being removed (a credit)

and what the new total contract price becomes.

It’s simple, but important. Without a change order, arguments explode later about “who agreed to what.”
So it acts like a financial bookmark that keeps everyone honest.

Analogy:
Imagine you’re at a barbershop.
You ask for a haircut ($30), but halfway through you say, “Can you also trim my beard?” The barber says, “That’s $10 extra.”
A change order is the written note that says:
“Haircut $30 + Beard trim $10 = $40 total.”
No surprises. No fights."

Example: A municipality uses CCDC 2 to award a $5 million bid for its new library, locking in the price and scope agreed in the contract."
card333,What is a material mistake in contract law?,"A material mistake is a significant error about a fact central to the contract that existed when the agreement was made, allowing the mistaken party to void the contract.

Example: Alice buys what she believes is an original painting. After signing, she learns it's a cheap replica. Because authenticity was essential, she can cancel the deal.

Difficult word:
Voidable - able to be legally canceled or undone by one party."
card334,Doctrine of Estoppel-What stops a party from enforcing strict contract terms after they've let the other side ignore them?,"A legal rule that prevents someone from insisting on a strict contract right if they previously waived it or led the other side to believe they would be lenient.

Example: A landlord accepts late rent for months without penalty. Later, they cannot suddenly enforce a late‐fee for those same missed due dates.

Difficult word:Waive - to voluntarily give up a right."

card359,Committee membership restriction: Can you serve on both the Investigation (Complaints) Committee and the Discipline Committee?(Investigation Committee - gathers and reviews complaints; Discipline Committee - holds formal hearings),"No - you may join only one committee at a time, ensuring the investigative and disciplinary stages stay independent and impartial.

You can’t be on both the Investigation and Discipline Committees at the same time.
This rule helps make sure that fact-finding and decision-making stay separate.
The idea is to keep the process fair, with no one person influencing both steps.
You must choose one role—either help investigate or help decide punishment.
It avoids conflict of interest and keeps everything neutral.

Example:

Imagine you're part of a school panel.
If you help gather facts about a cheating case, you shouldn’t also decide the punishment.
Why? Because you might be biased from already seeing the evidence.
So, one group checks the facts, and another group decides what to do.
That’s why you can only join one committee—it keeps things honest and fair.
This way, no one has too much power in the process."

card365,Legally enforceable part of a patent,"The Claims section - it defines the protected features of the invention.

The claims section of a patent is the only part that’s legally protected. It lists the specific features of the invention that others can’t copy. If someone breaks those rules, the inventor can sue them. Other parts of the patent explain things, but only the claims can be enforced in court.

Example:

An inventor patents a new type of water filter. The patent has drawings and descriptions, but the claims section says, “a filter with a triple-layer mesh and a carbon core.” If someone else makes a filter with that same setup, the inventor can take legal action. Only what's in the claims is legally protected.

Alex invents a new type of phone charger and gets a patent. In the Claims section, he describes the exact design and how it works. Another company copies his design. Because it’s covered in his patent claims, Alex can sue them for infringement. The claims define his legal rights."
card366,What triggers the requirement for a prime contractor under Canadian Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) regulations for a construction project?,"The requirement for a prime contractor is triggered when two or more employers work simultaneously at a construction site. The prime contractor, designated in the contract, coordinates and ensures the safety of employees and the public. If not specified, the owner assumes this role.

Example: A site with a plumbing and framing contractor requires a prime contractor to manage safety, like ensuring fall protection. (Syllabus topic I.2, Ethics 5th ed. p.146 or 6th ed. p.145)"

card372,What is a tort?,"A civil wrong where someone’s actions (or carelessness) cause harm to another person, and the injured person can sue for compensation instead of criminal punishment.

A tort happens when one person hurts another person or their property, even if it wasn’t on purpose.
It’s not a crime, so no one goes to jail — but the injured person can sue for money to make up for their loss.
Torts cover things like accidents (negligence), defamation, or trespassing.
It’s part of civil law, not criminal law.
In short: a tort means “you hurt me — now fix it with money.”"
card373,What is a letter of intent (LOI)?,"short note showing intent to sign a full contract later.

A letter of intent is like saying, “I’m serious about this deal, but we’re not signing the final contract yet.”
It shows someone’s interest and commitment, but without all the final details locked in.
It’s often used in business, jobs, or big projects to start things off.
Think of it like a promise to keep talking and move forward.
It’s not legally binding (usually), but it shows you’re not just window-shopping.
It helps get everyone on the same page before the real contract."

card383,After ADR uncovers professional misconduct,"ADR stops and a formal complaint goes to the regulator to protect the public.

If ADR finds signs of professional misconduct, the process stops right away.
Instead of continuing the dispute, a formal complaint is sent to the regulator.
This is done to protect the public from harm and hold the professional accountable.

Example

During a mediation, a client reveals their accountant faked tax documents.
Because that’s professional misconduct, the ADR process ends.
A complaint is filed with the accounting board.
The board investigates and may suspend the accountant’s license.
This step puts public safety before finishing the private dispute."
card384,Allowed ways to end a contract after contractor's fundamental breach,"(1) Keep contractor & sue for damages or (2) Terminate & sue for damages.

If a contractor seriously breaks the contract (called a fundamental breach), you have two options:

Continue with the contractor but ask the court for money to cover your losses.

End the contract completely and then go to court to get money for the damage.
These are the legal choices available when the contractor does something really wrong that ruins the deal.

Example:

Let’s say a contractor was hired to build a swimming pool, but they used the wrong materials and made it unsafe.
As the client, you could keep the contractor to fix it but ask for money for the problems.
Or, you could cancel the contract and sue them to pay for the damages and hire someone else.
Both ways are allowed if the mistake is big enough.
A small mistake wouldn’t count—it has to be serious.
This protects you if the contractor really messes up."
card385,"Which of the following is NOT a role performed by technical societies in Canada?

A) Providing technical resources such as journals, conferences, and training
B) Supporting professional development and networking
C) Developing technical standards in specialized fields
D) Licensing engineers and geoscientists to legally practice","D) Licensing engineers and geoscientists to legally practice

When we talk about technical societies (like IEEE, ASME, CSCE, CIM, etc.), their job is to support the technical growth of professionals. They publish journals, host conferences, set technical standards, and help engineers learn new things.

But they do NOT have any legal power.

They cannot:

• Give you a licence
• Allow you to legally call yourself P.Eng. or P.Geo.
• Discipline you for unethical behaviour
• Give you permission to practise engineering or geoscience

Those powers belong only to provincial/territorial regulators (like APEGA, EGBC, PEO, Engineers Geoscientists Manitoba, etc.). Regulators exist because engineering and geoscience affect public safety, so the government gives these regulators legal authority.

Think of it this way, Nima:
A technical society is like a gym — a place to train, practice, connect, and get better.
A regulator is like the government licensing office — the place that decides who is legally allowed to drive."

card398,"What does “per diem” pay mean, and when is it useful?","Per diem = paid by a daily rate. It’s useful when the total length of the job is uncertain, so workers are fairly paid for each day they work.

(Example

A consultant is hired for a project with no set end date.
Instead of guessing the total cost, the company offers $400 per diem.
That means the consultant gets $400 each day they work.
If they work 3 days, they earn $1,200.
This method keeps things simple while the project details are still unclear.

card458,"In Callum's fraud case, can he use double jeopardy to block civil claims?",No. It doesn't apply to civil claims.
card459,What defense stops a second criminal prosecution for the same crime?,Double jeopardy.
card460,Double jeopardy does not block which actions?,"civil

(Criminal case = government tries to punish (jail/fine).

Civil case = a person/business wants compensation (money) or a court order.
Double jeopardy only blocks the criminal do-over. The civil lane stays open.

Example: You’re found not guilty of careless driving in criminal court. The injured driver can still sue you for damages in civil court. That lawsuit is not blocked.)"
card461,What kinds of consequences can follow a criminal conviction besides jail?,"Heavy fines, civil damages, and license revocation. (License REVOCATION is the most important one!)

If you're convicted of a crime, jail isn’t the only consequence.
You might also get big fines, be forced to pay money to victims, or even lose your professional license.
License revocation is the most serious for professionals—it means you can’t legally work in your field anymore.
So, a criminal record can ruin your career, not just your freedom.
These extra penalties are often long-term and life-changing.

3) Example

Say an engineer is convicted of fraud in a project.
They might get fined $50,000, and the client could sue for civil damages.
But the worst part? Their engineering license gets revoked.
Now they can’t sign or work on engineering projects again.
Even after jail or fines, that career damage lasts forever.
So, one conviction can lead to multiple serious consequences."

card484,What is the Persian translation of Tort?,"The closest Persian word for the legal term ""tort"" is «مسئولیت مدنی» (mas'uliyyat-e madanī), literally ""civil responsibility.""

Example
English: ""Trespass is an intentional tort.""
Persian: «تجاوز به ملک دیگری یک مسئولیت مدنی عمدی است.»"
card485,What is Tort?,"1) Advanced Phrases
Tort : A civil wrong where someone can be sued for harm they caused. Intentional tort A tort done on purpose, not by accident. 2) Simplified ExplanationA tort is a type of wrongful act that hurts someone else and can lead to a lawsuit for money damages. When the act is intentional (done on purpose), it is called an intentional tort—examples are fraud, trespass, and defamation. If the harm happens by accident or carelessness, it falls under negligence, not an intentional tort. In short, tort law deals with making the person who caused the harm legally responsible to compensate the victim."
card486,What is the Persian translation of competence?,توانمندی
card487,What is an Act in the context of Canadian law?,"A law passed by the (federal or provincial) government that sets out broad, general rules applicable across the entire country or province."
card488,What is a Bylaw and who creates it?,"A bylaw is a rule made by a local group, like a city or association, to control what happens in its own area or with its own members. It can’t go against  overarching Acts, but it can add extra rules that fit local needs. So, it’s like a custom set of rules for a specific place or group. "
card489,"What's the difference between an Act, a Regulation, and a Bylaw in Canadian law?","Act: A broad law passed by federal or provincial government, setting out general rules.

Regulation: Detailed instructions made under an Act, explaining how to apply its rules in specific situations.

Bylaw: Local rules created by municipalities or professional bodies—must follow the parent Act and its Regulations but can add further requirements."
card490,Lien Law - What is it and how does it protect you?,"A legal right allowing contractors or suppliers who aren't paid to register a ""lien"" (a hold) on the property, so it can't be sold or refinanced until the debt is settled.

Example: You install a $10 000 HVAC system and aren't paid—file a lien, and the owner must pay you before selling the house."
card491,What are the three stages of the professional discipline process?,"1. Gathering evidence
2. Investigation and peer review
3. Discipline hearing"
card492,What does RFQ stand for?,"RFQ stands for Request for Qualification.

This is a formal way a company or client asks engineering firms or professionals to show their skills, experience, and qualifications before getting hired for a project. It helps the client shortlist the most capable people before moving on to cost talks or proposals.

Example:

Imagine a city wants to build a new bridge. Before picking a company, they send out an RFQ to see which companies have the right experience, skills, and engineers. Companies reply with details about past projects and resumes of key staff. The city reviews all the RFQs and selects a few top firms. Then they may ask those firms for a full proposal or quote. This helps ensure only qualified professionals get considered for big, important work."

card497,Personal protective equipment (PPE) under OHS law,Worker wears it; employer supplies it.
card498,Cradle-to-grave hazard assessment,"Covers all hazards from initial construction through operation to final decommissioning.

A cradle-to-grave hazard assessment would start by looking at risks during construction (e.g. equipment injuries).
Then it would check for dangers during operation (like overheating or chemical leaks).
Finally, it would plan for safe shutdown and removal, like disposing of waste or taking apart machinery.
So instead of just checking once, this method tracks safety from beginning to end."

card503,What does Canada's mobility provision under the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) allow for licensed engineers and geoscientists?,"They can apply for and obtain a licence in any province or territory with only minimal extra steps (e.g. proof of good standing, fees)—no need to redo exams or qualifications.

Example: A P.Eng. licensed in Ontario moves to British Columbia and becomes licensed there simply by submitting their Ontario licence and paying BC's application fee."
card504,"Does a thesis-based master's degree count toward the required work experience for engineering licensure?

Thesis-based: a graduate program requiring original research and a written thesis.","No—each provincial/territorial association decides.

- Some (e.g. APEGA) grant up to 12 months of experience credit for a research master's.
- Others (e.g. PEO) give no credit.

Example:• Alberta engineer with an M.Sc. research thesis may reduce experience requirement by one year.• In Ontario, the same degree won't shorten the four-year experience mandate."

card509,What is the key phrase in professional mentoring that captures a mentor's role in exemplifying ethical standards?,"Be self-aware about your own professionalism; model the standard.

Example.
Imagine you're mentoring a new engineer, Jamie:
Self-aware: Before each site visit, you reflect, ""Am I following all safety rules myself?""
Model the standard: You always wear your hard hat, high-vis vest, and safety boots—even when it's inconvenient—and you complete the safety checklist out loud, inviting Jamie to observe.
By openly checking your own safety practices and demonstrating them every time, you show Jamie exactly what professional, ethical behaviour looks like—rather than just telling them."

card523,Mill's qualitative factors for maximum benefit,"Number of people, intensity of benefit, duration of benefit."
card524,What is influence peddling?,"Selling the influence of your position on someone else's behalf in return for money or favours.

Influence peddling means using your power or connections to help someone get special treatment, usually in exchange for money or favours.
It’s often seen as corrupt or unethical, even if it’s not always illegal.
The key point is you're trading access or influence for personal gain.

Example

A government official helps a business get a contract by calling in a favor.
In return, the business gives the official a free vacation.
This is influence peddling, because the official used their position to help someone and got something back.
It’s not fair to others and can hurt trust in the system."
card525,What is self‑dealing?,"Self‑dealing means you use your position to help yourself or your family instead of treating everyone fairly.

Example: A hiring manager fills three new openings by directly appointing her brother, sister‑in‑law, and cousin—without reviewing any other applicants."
card526,Unethical review,Secretly reviewing a colleague's work for the same employer is unethical because the Code requires informing the original practitioner (unless their link to the work is terminated).
card527,Whistle-blowing,The first step before 'whistle-blowing' externally is to attempt to resolve the issue through internal channels.
card528,Ethical requirement for sealing,"If a friend asks you to seal her drawing, the ethical requirement is to refuse unless you do a full review and are willing to accept responsibility."
card529,Primary obligation before sealing,"When you rely on work received from another P.Eng., your primary obligation before sealing is to verify the work is fit for its intended purpose; perform enough review/tests to accept full responsibility."

card534,Love Canal disaster (1970s),"Core cause: Massive health & environmental damage traced to improper chemical-waste disposal, prompting tougher waste-handling laws."
card535,Commercial General Liability vs. Errors & Omissions insurance,"E&O (professional liability) covers design/consulting negligence; CGL covers third-party bodily injury/property damage.

E&O insurance protects you if you make a mistake in your professional work, like a design error.
CGL insurance protects you if someone is hurt or their property is damaged because of your work.
E&O covers intellectual or service-based risks, while CGL covers physical risks.
So, E&O is for wrong advice or design, and CGL is for accidents or injuries.
Most professionals need both types to stay fully protected.

3) Example

Imagine you're an engineer.
If your design has a flaw that causes a project delay, E&O covers that.
But if someone trips over your equipment at the site and breaks a leg, CGL handles that.
E&O is about what you think or draw, and CGL is about what physically happens.
They cover different kinds of risks, and one doesn’t replace the other.
That's why companies usually carry both.

card546,What type of insurance protects professionals from being sued for mistakes or negligence in their work?,"Errors and Omissions (E&O) Liability Insurance.

E&O Insurance protects professionals (like engineers, architects, or consultants) when a client sues them for a mistake they made or something important they forgot in their work. It covers legal costs, settlements, or damage payouts. This insurance is important even if the mistake wasn’t on purpose — just a professional error or oversight.

3) Example

Let’s say an engineer designs a building, but forgets to include a drainage system. After construction, flooding causes damage, and the client sues the engineer. Even though it wasn’t done on purpose, it was a mistake. E&O insurance helps cover the legal fees and cost of damages. Without it, the engineer would have to pay everything out-of-pocket."
card547,Rule for applying a professional seal,Only on final documents containing technical information that others will rely on - never on preliminary drafts.
card548,"What are ""as-built"" drawings in an engineering project, and who typically prepares and seals them?","""As-built"" drawings are mark-ups, typically by someone other than the design engineer (e.g., contractor), showing actual on-site conditions after construction. They are generally not sealed by a P.Eng./P.Geo., as they reflect field changes rather than design intent.

Example: A contractor updates piping drawings to show rerouted pipes due to on-site obstacles, but the P.Eng. does not seal them. (Syllabus topic I.3, Ethics 5th ed. p.51 or 6th ed. p.48)"
card549,"If an engineer omits their professional seal from a document, does it eliminate their legal liability?","No. Liability (legal responsibility) arises from the engineer's involvement in the work, not from whether the seal was applied."
card550,Charging a fee for applying a seal,"No. Sealing is part of normal professional duty; fees may be charged only for review work, not for the stamp itself."

card561,Whistle-blowing & job security,Justified reporting of unsafe/illegal practice is not grounds for dismissal; wrongful dismissal can be sued for lost wages.
card562,Hartford Coliseum (1978) lesson,"Negligence: engineers relied only on computer analysis; should have cross-checked with hand methods (e.g., Euler buckling).

In the 1978 Hartford Coliseum collapse, engineers relied only on computers and didn’t double-check their work using basic hand calculations like Euler buckling. This was considered negligence because a good engineer should always verify computer results manually to catch errors. The lesson here: technology helps, but it doesn’t replace engineering judgment.

Example:

An engineer uses software to check if a roof design is safe. The software says everything’s fine, but the engineer doesn’t do any simple hand checks. Later, the roof collapses under its own weight because the software missed a critical issue. If the engineer had done a basic Euler buckling calculation, the weakness would’ve been clear. This kind of oversight is what happened at the Hartford Coliseum — and it’s a classic case of why human checks matter."

card589,Canada's two legal systems,Québec follows French civil law; all other provinces follow British common law.
card590,What are the three primary intentional torts relevant to professional engineering and geoscience practice in Canada?,"The three primary intentional torts are Fraud, Trespass, and Defamation. These involve deliberate actions, unlike negligence, which is unintentional.

Example: A P.Eng. knowingly misrepresents project risks (fraud), enters private land without permission (trespass), or falsely claims a colleague's incompetence (defamation). (Syllabus topic I.3, Law text p.12 or p.18)"
card591,Relationship between statutes and the Constitution,"Statutes must be compatible with the Constitution or they're invalid.

All laws (statutes) must follow the Constitution, which is the top law of the country. If a law goes against the Constitution, it is not valid. Courts can strike down or cancel such laws. This ensures all laws respect basic rights and rules set by the Constitution. No law can be higher than it.

Example:

Suppose a province makes a law that limits free speech. If that law goes against the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution, a court can say the law is invalid. Even though it was passed properly, it doesn’t count because it violates the Constitution.

Additional note:
The Supreme Court of Canada is the main interpreter of the Constitution. When there’s a dispute about what the Constitution means or if a law breaks it, the Supreme Court makes the final decision. The court’s rulings help shape and apply the Constitution in real life. Its decisions are binding—everyone must follow them. So, the Constitution gives the rules, and the Supreme Court explains how to use them.

Example:

If a law is passed that limits freedom of religion, people might argue it violates the Constitution. The case could go to the Supreme Court. The judges would study the Constitution, especially the Charter of Rights, and decide if the law is allowed. Their ruling becomes the official interpretation of that part of the Constitution."

card593,"Meaning of ""primacy legislation"" (Charter & human-rights codes)",They can override any conflicting law within their jurisdiction.
card594,"After Canada signs an international trade treaty, who must comply?","All levels - federal, provincial/territorial, and municipal governments."
card595,Association discipline process - at which phases can an expert witness be hired?,"Stage 1 (evidence-gathering) to help prepare a technical complaint, and Stage 3 (discipline hearing) to give sworn technical testimony."

card597,Hazard can't be eliminated - two precautions a professional must take,Install physical guards and post prominent warning signs to protect workers & public.
card598,Canadian court level that most often decides Charter of Rights & Freedoms cases,"Supreme Court of Canada.

The Supreme Court of Canada is the court that most often makes final decisions about cases involving the Charter of Rights & Freedoms. It looks at whether laws or actions by the government violate Canadians’ rights. Once the Supreme Court decides, its ruling is final and must be followed across Canada. It acts like the top referee in legal disputes about rights.

Example:

A law in a province limits public protests. Someone challenges it, saying it violates the freedom of expression in the Charter. The case goes through lower courts and finally reaches the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court decides the law is unconstitutional. That ruling applies nationwide and can’t be appealed further."

card600,Right that lets a landowner cross neighbouring property for access,Easement (runs with the land).
card601,"Even if a case's facts match an older precedent, why might a court still refuse to follow that precedent?","Because subsequent judicial decisions, legislative changes, or material factual differences can override or distinguish the old rule—courts aren't bound when the law or key facts have evolved.

Example: A 1980 ruling on pesticide liability may be set aside today if newer statutes change industry standards or scientific evidence shows different health risks."
card602,Is unequal pay for the same job always illegal discrimination?,"No. Employers may pay differently for legitimate job-related factors like greater experience or seniority; human-rights codes prohibit discrimination only on protected grounds (e.g., sex, race, age). An employer can differentiate based on experience, and “protected grounds” are what human-rights statutes bar."
card603,Cutting an employee's salary 20% without consent,Treated as constructive dismissal - employee may treat contract as terminated and sue for severance/notice.
card604,Easement,"A legal right allowing someone to use another person's land for a specific purpose.
An easement is like a permission slip that lets one person use part of another person's property without owning it. It gives a specific right—for example, to walk, drive, or run a utility line—over land they don't own. Easements stay with the land, so if the property is sold, the new owner still has that right. They help neighbors avoid conflicts by clearly laying out who can do what on which parts of the land.

Jane owns a house behind Tom's house and needs to walk across Tom's yard to reach the public sidewalk. Tom grants Jane an easement allowing her to use that path anytime. Jane doesn't own Tom's yard—she only has the right to walk along that path. If Jane sells her house, the new owner also keeps that walking right. Without the easement, Jane might have to build a costly private sidewalk or negotiate access each time."
card605,Role of an expert witness,"Give neutral, independent technical opinion - not act as advocate for either party."
card606,Trademark Registration-What's required to secure exclusive nationwide rights and enforce your trademark?,"To gain exclusive nationwide rights—and sue for infringement (unauthorized use) or passing-off (misrepresenting goods/services as yours)—you must either:

1. Register your trademark federally, or
2. Establish common-law trademark rights by long-standing, public use in a specific region.

Example: CoffeeCo™ registers ""FreshBrew"" across Canada. If another café starts selling coffee under ""FreshBrew,"" CoffeeCo™ can bring an infringement or passing-off lawsuit to stop them."
card607,What is an impact claim in construction contracts?,"A claim by the contractor detailing extra costs or time caused by the owner's delay, which preserves the contractor's right to recover those additional expenses."
card608,What is the purpose of an opening statement in mediation?,"It allows each side to outline its view of the dispute before joint discussion begins.

The purpose of an opening statement in mediation is to let each side outline its view of the dispute. It’s a short, uninterrupted chance to say what happened and what matters most. After both sides speak, they move into a joint discussion with the mediator to ask questions and explore solutions.

Example

Two coworkers are mediating a scheduling conflict. In her opening statement, Alex says she needs mornings for childcare and wants a fair rotation. Jordan’s opening statement explains he covers most early shifts and wants balance. Then they begin a joint discussion with the mediator. They clarify priorities and constraints. They consider a rotating schedule that splits mornings evenly."
card609,"Under a construction change order, what terms are used for price increases and for price decreases?","Price increases are called extras, and price decreases are called credits."
card610,Who normally pays an expert witness?,"The party that hired them. And,the payment must not depend on the outcome of the trial."
card611,Estoppel,A legal tool that stops a party from enforcing strict contract wording after giving a free waiver.
card612,Patentability test in Canada,Novelty + ingenuity + utility - the invention must work and be useful.
card613,What is a 10% bid bond?,"A 10% bid bond is a guarantee that the bidder will enter the contract if their bid is accepted.
If the bidder backs out, the surety pays the owner up to the bond amount (typically 10% of the bid).
This protects the owner from costs and delays caused by a no-show contractor.
It encourages serious, reliable bids.

Example

A contractor bids $500,000 on a project with a 10% bid bond.
They win, but refuse to sign the contract.
The surety must pay the owner up to $50,000 (10% of $500,000).
The owner uses this money to cover the extra cost of hiring the next bidder.
Because of the bond, the owner isn’t left completely exposed."
card614,Three pillars of Canada's Constitution,1 Division of powers • 2 Creation of the courts • 3 Charter of Rights & Freedoms (the Criminal Code is not one of them).
card615,Appointment of arbitrator,Either party can ask the court to appoint the arbitrator.
card616,Absolute right under OHS laws in Canada,You may refuse the work until the danger is investigated.
card617,Limited partnership,A partnership where a partner invests money but does not run the business and has limited liability.
card618,Force-majeure clause,A clause that protects you from schedule penalties when floods or other 'acts of God' strike.
card619,What is the contra proferentem rule in contract law?,"When a contract term is ambiguous, the court interprets it against the party who drafted (wrote) that term.

Example: A supplier's contract says ""delivery within 30 days"" without specifying start date. If disputed, the court will construe ""30 days"" in the way least favourable to the supplier (the drafter)."
card620,Possible consequences after a practice review finds unskilled practice,"Fines, permit/practice revoked or restricted, and the decision may be published."
card621,CPD requirements after absence,"Once you return to practice you must restart meeting the CPD requirements; missed years are not retro-billed.

After a break, when you return to practice, you start meeting CPD requirements again from that point forward.
You do not have to pay for or make up the missed years—they are not retro-billed.
So, focus on completing the current CPD, not the past.

Example

A lawyer takes two years off for parental leave.
When she returns in 2025, she must meet the 2025 CPD requirements.
She doesn’t have to complete 2023–2024 CPD or pay for it.
She just follows the current year’s CPD rules going forward."
card622,"Education Half-Life of a Degree-What does ""education half-life"" mean for professionals?","Over time, the relevance of what you learned in your degree decays (loses relevance) as technology and best practices evolve. The ""half-life"" is the period in which roughly half of your original knowledge becomes outdated, making ongoing learning essential to stay competent.

Example: If a computer science degree has an education half-life of 5 years, then about half of what you learned when you graduated will be obsolete after five years—so you need continual training to keep up.

Difficult word:Decay: to gradually lose strength or effectiveness."
card623,"Under provincial/territorial Occupational Health & Safety Acts, what action can a worker take when faced with a dangerous task?","Workers have the legal right to stop work and refuse tasks they reasonably believe are unsafe.Example: On a construction site, if a worker notices a scaffold platform missing planks, they can refuse to climb it and report the hazard to their supervisor without fear of reprisal."
card624,What five elements are required for a contract to be legally enforceable?(Enforceable = a court will uphold it),"1. Offer & Acceptance - One side proposes terms; the other agrees.
2. Mutual Intent - Both parties intend to be bound.
3. Consideration - Each gives something of value (money, service).
4. Capacity - Parties are competent (e.g., adults of sound mind).
5. Lawful Purpose - The contract's goal must be legal.

Example: You offer $200 for a friend to paint your room, they accept, both intend a binding deal, you'll pay $200 (consideration), you're both adults (capacity), and painting is legal (lawful purpose)."
card625,What is estoppel in contract law?,"When one party knowingly gives up (""waives"") a strict right under a contract and the other party relies on that waiver, a court will prevent the first party from later enforcing the original term.

Example:A landlord tells a tenant it's okay to pay rent up to three days late each month. The tenant relies on this and pays late for several months. The landlord cannot suddenly enforce the strict ""due on the first"" clause for those months—they're estopped (stopped) from doing so."
card626,"In a practice review, what's the main focus for an individual member vs. a firm?","Individual: Are they staying competent and honestly logging their CPD?

Firm: Is it following its PPMP (Professional Practice Management Plan)?

Example:
Individual: Jane logs 30 CPD hours and demonstrates up-to-date technical skills.
Firm: Acme Engineering follows its written QA procedures for every project."
card627,What's a common penalty the Discipline Committee can impose on a licensed member?,"Impose terms or conditions on their licence (e.g., practice under supervision, complete specified courses).Example: An engineer found guilty must work under a senior mentor for one year and finish a ethics refresher course."
card628,Main power of the association when the public complains,Can discipline its member (it can't award money to the complainant).
card629,What is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)?,"Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) refers to methods of resolving disputes outside of traditional court litigation, often involving a neutral third party to facilitate a resolution. It offers a more flexible, and sometimes faster and less expensive, approach to conflict resolution compared to going to court."
card630,Professional misconduct,Unethical behaviour.
card631,Informal CPD example,Attending a conference workshop (informal = learning with no exam or credential).
card632,"In an individual practice review, which item is not examined?","The member's firm-level Professional Practice Management Plan (PPMP) is not reviewed.

A PPMP is the company's written policies, procedures, and quality controls.

Example: The PRB will check Maria's CPD record and technical competence, but it won't audit her employer's PPMP."

They don’t need a joint safety committee unless they have 20 or more workers.
So, for smaller workplaces like this, one trained person is enough."

card738,difference between voiding and breaching the contract,"✅ 1. Breaching a Contract (the simpler one)

A breach happens when one party breaks a valid contract.

The contract is real, legal, and enforceable…
…but someone fails to do what they promised.

Examples of breach:

A contractor doesn’t finish the work.

An engineer misses deadlines or delivers poor-quality work.

An owner doesn’t pay.

When a contract is breached, the innocent party can usually:

ask for damages (money),

end the contract,

or sometimes force performance.

Key idea:
The contract is valid, but someone broke it.

✅ 2. Voiding a Contract (very different)

To void a contract means the contract is treated as if it never legally existed at all.

It’s not “broken.”
It’s invalid — like a fake driver’s licence.

A contract may be void or voidable if:

one party was misled (misrepresentation)

there was no capacity (mental incapacity, minors)

there was duress or coercion

the subject of the contract is illegal

the contract is missing essential elements (like no consideration)

When a contract is void, nobody can enforce it.

Key idea:
A void contract is not legally real, so nobody can “breach” it.

🧠 Think of it like this:
Breach = The rulebook is valid, but a player broke the rules.
Void = The rulebook itself was fake or invalid from the start.
🌰 Nima-Friendly Analogy

Imagine you and a contractor sign a contract to build a deck at your house.

Scenario 1 — Breach (the contract is real):

Contractor agrees to build your deck but disappears halfway through.
He breached the contract.
You can sue him for damages because the contract was valid.

Scenario 2 — Void (the contract never legally existed):

The contractor turns out to be unlicensed, lied about qualifications, and forged documents to get the job.
Your contract is void — it’s like signing a deal with someone who pretended to be a doctor.
It was never valid from the beginning."
