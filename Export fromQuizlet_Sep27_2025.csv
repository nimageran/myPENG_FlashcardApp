What is the Persian translation of Tort?,"The closest Persian word for the legal term ""tort"" is «مسئولیت مدنی» (mas'uliyyat-e madanī), literally ""civil responsibility.""

Example
English: ""Trespass is an intentional tort.""
Persian: «تجاوز به ملک دیگری یک مسئولیت مدنی عمدی است.»"
What is Tort?,"1) Advanced Phrases
Tort : A civil wrong where someone can be sued for harm they caused. Intentional tort A tort done on purpose, not by accident. 2) Simplified ExplanationA tort is a type of wrongful act that hurts someone else and can lead to a lawsuit for money damages. When the act is intentional (done on purpose), it is called an intentional tort—examples are fraud, trespass, and defamation. If the harm happens by accident or carelessness, it falls under negligence, not an intentional tort. In short, tort law deals with making the person who caused the harm legally responsible to compensate the victim."

Cutting an employee's salary 20% without consent,Treated as constructive dismissal - employee may treat contract as terminated and sue for severance/notice.
Easement,"A legal right allowing someone to use another person's land for a specific purpose.
An easement is like a permission slip that lets one person use part of another person's property without owning it. It gives a specific right—for example, to walk, drive, or run a utility line—over land they don't own. Easements stay with the land, so if the property is sold, the new owner still has that right. They help neighbors avoid conflicts by clearly laying out who can do what on which parts of the land.

Jane owns a house behind Tom's house and needs to walk across Tom's yard to reach the public sidewalk. Tom grants Jane an easement allowing her to use that path anytime. Jane doesn't own Tom's yard—she only has the right to walk along that path. If Jane sells her house, the new owner also keeps that walking right.

"Education Half-Life of a Degree-What does ""education half-life"" mean for professionals?","Over time, the relevance of what you learned in your degree decays (loses relevance) as technology and best practices evolve. The ""half-life"" is the period in which roughly half of your original knowledge becomes outdated, making ongoing learning essential to stay competent.

Example: If a computer science degree has an education half-life of 5 years, then about half of what you learned when you graduated will be obsolete after five years—so you need continual training to keep up.

Difficult word:Decay: to gradually lose strength or effectiveness."
"Under provincial/territorial Occupational Health & Safety Acts, what action can a worker take when faced with a dangerous task?","Workers have the legal right to stop work and refuse tasks they reasonably believe are unsafe.Example: On a construction site, if a worker notices a scaffold platform missing planks, they can refuse to climb it and report the hazard to their supervisor without fear of reprisal."

3. Consideration - Each gives something of value (money, service).
4. Capacity - Parties are competent (e.g., adults of sound mind).

What is estoppel in contract law?,"When one party knowingly gives up (""waives"") a strict right under a contract and the other party relies on that waiver, a court will prevent the first party from later enforcing the original term.

Example:A landlord tells a tenant it's okay to pay rent up to three days late each month. The tenant relies on this and pays late for several months. The landlord cannot suddenly enforce the strict ""due on the first"" clause for those months—they're estopped (stopped) from doing so."
